# Fondik

This project takes care of advertisment calling and it's proper functioning.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and then download the dependencies by running:

- `npm install`

Run the webpack bundler by typing:

- `npm run build`

This will bundle the whole code, which then can be found in `/dist/main.js`. Copying this code into a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` tag of the fondik website will implement all the changes.
